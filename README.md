## Introduction
Hi, my name is Chi Nguyen, and this is my portfolio.

I am a student at California State University, Long Beach. I enjoy analyzing business data, uncovering insights, and presenting them through clear visualizations. 
My background includes business data analysis, project management, and statistics, with strong skills in tools like Excel, PowerPoint, SAS, and R.

This repository contains projects that demonstrate my analytical and technical skills with tools like Excel, PowerPoint, SAS, R, and others. The projects involve analyzing business data, creating reports, and visualizing insights to support decision-making.

For more information, please refer to my CV [here](Chi_Nguyen_CV.pdf).

## Projects

### Assessing Loan Status Analysis
- **Description**: The goal of this project is to predict which loans are likely to be repaid and which may default, helping lenders make smarter lending decisions. The analysis leverages various predictive modeling techniques to assess loan status and enhance decision-making.
- **Data**: The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains more than 32,000 loan records with 12 predictors. A random sample of 1,000 observations was selected for analysis. The key variables include loan status (binary: repaid or defaulted), loan amount, income, loan interest rate, years of employment, loan intent, and home ownership status.
- **Tools Used**: R, SAS, Excel, PowerPoint
- **Skills**: Analytical problem-solving, data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization, and application of predictive modeling techniques.
- **Approach**: Logistic regression models, including complementary log-log, were tested to predict loan repayment likelihood. Evaluation of model performance was done using criteria such as AIC, AICC, and BIC. Significant predictors were identified, and model sensitivity was tested through hypothetical scenarios.

- **Result**: The complementary log-log model proved to be the most effective for predicting loan repayment. Key factors influencing repayment likelihood included income, loan amount, interest rate, loan intent, and home ownership status. The model demonstrated high sensitivity to home ownership, with renters showing a significantly higher risk of default.

### Body Image of Patients with Cancer
- **Description**: This study aims to gather insights into cancer patients' perceptions of their body image, using statistical analysis to explore factors influencing their self-image and psychological well-being.
- **Data**: The data, collected between 2002 and 2016, involved 536 cancer patients from inpatient (rehabilitation clinic Oberharz, municipal hospital Braunschweig, university hospital Munich) and outpatient settings (oncology practices in Braunschweig). Participants were of full age, spoke German, and had no apparent mental disorders.
- **Tools Used**: SAS, R, PowerPoint, Excel.
- **Skills**: Analytical problem-solving, data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization, and application of predictive modeling techniques.
- **Approach**: One-way ANOVA, Tukey test, Kruskal-Wallis H-test, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test were used to examine statistical differences across patient groups.
[Body Image Approach](Body_Image_Approach.pdf)
- **Result**: Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in body image perceptions based on work status, particularly between employed and retired individuals. However, no notable differences were observed in relation to education level or between other work-status groups.

### Animal Movement in Foraging Analysis
- **Description**: This project analyzes animal movement patterns in relation to foraging behavior and environmental factors, focusing on whether movements are random or influenced by memory.
- **Data**: The dataset, from Bracis et al. (2015), includes animal movement data during foraging, covering metrics like step lengths, turning angles, and displacement over time. Key variables include turning angles, distance traveled, and resource regeneration rate.
- **Tools Used**: R, Excel, PowerPoint.
- **Skills**: Analytical problem-solving, data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization, and application of predictive modeling techniques.
- **Approach**: Random walk models were used to examine animal movement. The analysis involved visualizing movement patterns, calculating turning angles, and assessing the impact of resource regeneration rates on travel distance.
[Animal Movement Approach](Animal_Movement_Approach.pdf)
- **Result**: The analysis revealed that resource availability significantly influenced the animal movement, with scarce resources leading to wider foraging areas. Movement patterns suggested a memory-guided strategy rather than random exploration, as indicated by strong directional persistence and consistent travel paths.
